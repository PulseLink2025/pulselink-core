 Message to the Dev Community



Hello Devs,



My name is Daniel Postle, and I haven't considered myself a "coder" for a very long time. I’ve always had a slightly above-average knack for tech, but never code. I once worked at a small repair shop in Arkansas called Computer Medic, downloading drivers and doing grunt work. My boss used to code, and I’d watch when I could. But I never had the chance to truly stop and learn. Until I started PulseLink. A month into building my site, everything just clicked. It was like that scene from The Da Vinci Code, where suddenly it all made sense. Quite an amazing moment. And it all started the first time I saw a few lines of code on DOS, back in 2005.



That was 20 years ago. I was 20 then, and the whole world was still ahead of me.



In the years since, life took me down roads I never expected. Dozens of moves, the birth of my two incredible daughters (now 17 and 14), and experiences that I’ll never forget. Addiction. Loss. Estrangement. Pain. A lover gone. Friends and family lost. I won’t go into all of it here, but know that every piece of it led to this exact moment, where I now sit, working on something that feels like the culmination of all those years: PulseLink came to me 15 years ago. My little brother is an amazing guitarist. But we lived in a tiny town with dirt roads, one stoplight, and a grocery store that was the talk of the town. There were no other musicians around. No one to collaborate with. No one who got his passion for death metal. So eventually, he stopped pushing himself. He still plays. He still found friends. But I always wondered, what if he had connected with someone like him? Someone who pushed him further? Inspired him? Challenged him? That’s what PulseLink is for. It’s a place where musicians of every genre, every background, every level of experience can connect, compete, collaborate, and grow together.



Why I’m Going Open Source



I don’t want PulseLink to be just mine. This platform was built from pain, passion, and purpose. But it was always meant to be for the people. For the community. And what better way to prove that, than to open it up to you! The devs, the designers, the dreamers who see the potential and want to be part of something real. So now I’m asking, when you see what’s been built so far, when you feel the passion behind this project, do you believe this can be the next big thing? I do. And I want you to help shape it.Whether it’s building features, fixing bugs, offering feedback, or just sharing the story, your role matters. Because this isn’t just an app. This is a movement.



My name is Daniel Postle.

This is PulseLink.

And now, this is yours too. 



What Is PulseLink?



PulseLink is a social music platform that connects musicians of all kinds through powerful features like:

Pulse Battles: 30-second musical showdowns where users compete, vote, and climb the leaderboard

Linkups: Meet and collaborate with local and global musicians based on instrument, genre, experience and/or location

Legends Board: A dynamic ranking system influenced by performance, voting, and daily recognition

Showcase: Upload and display your performances for feedback, collaboration, or discovery. ( strictly limited to live, individual musical performances.) 

Daily Voting: Users can vote for others with a single gold "Legends" button, boosting their status

Power-Ups: Consumable boosts that affect visibility, battle results, or community interactions

The platform is designed to be stylish, fast, and emotionally engaging, with neon aesthetics, real-time effects, and intuitive user experience. We are building a living system that rewards creativity, connection, and competition.
